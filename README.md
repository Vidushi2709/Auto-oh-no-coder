# Auto-oh-coder 👗🤖

> "When life gives you MNIST, make **fashionable** reconstructions… poorly, but confidently."

Welcome to **auto-oh-coder**, the repo that proves two things:

1. Neural networks can look at your clothes and try to recreate them.
2. Sometimes they… don’t.

---

## What’s Inside?

* **VAE** – Variational Autoencoder that *tries* to reconstruct Fashion MNIST. Think of it as a creative friend who interprets your outfit in abstract art form.
* **Autoencoder** – Classic “let’s compress it and then decompress it” magic. AKA “how blurry can we make these shoes and still call them shoes?”

---

## Features

* Fashion MNIST reconstruction, because apparently your computer judges your taste in clothing. 👚👖
* VAE: Adds a sprinkle of randomness to make every reconstruction a surprise. 🎲
* Autoencoder: For the purists who just want their t-shirt to still look like a t-shirt… kinda.
* Guaranteed “ohhh… interesting” faces from anyone who sees the outputs. 😅

---

## How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vidushi2709/Auto-oh-no-coder.git
cd Auto-oh-coder
```

Sit back, relax, and watch your fashion sense get interpreted by a neural network that’s probably more confused than you are.

## Results

Expect output like:

| Original | Autoencoder | VAE |
| -------- | ----------- | --- |
| 👕       | 👕 (sorta)  | 🌀  |
| 👗       | 👗 (maybe)  | 😬  |

## Disclaimer

* No actual fashion expertise was used.
* Your clothes might never be safe again.
* Side effects include mild existential dread about how your computer sees the world.

## Contributing

* Sure, fork it, tweak it, break it, fix it. Just don’t blame your wardrobe.
